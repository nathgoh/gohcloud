# home-server
Repository containing all the relevant setup/projects I'm doing with my home server.

The main motiviation for creating a home server was to host my own personal cloud storage. 

# Server specifications
For my home server, I'm using a mini PC that you easily by off from Amazon or similar online retailers.

- Intel 12th Core 1220P (10C/12T)
- 24 GB LPDDR5 RAM
- Boot Drive: 256GB SSD
- Storage Drive: 1024 GB SSD

# Server setup
I installed [OpenMediaVault](https://www.openmediavault.org/) to replace Windows as my operating system. 

To setup all my projects in the home server, I use the OMV Docker compose [plugin](https://wiki.omv-extras.org/doku.php?id=omv6:omv6_plugins:docker_compose) to help manage and deploy my projects.
